            <p>
              Hi, my name is Mon Francis J. Morallos. I’m 15 years old and was born on October 8, 2009. I’m an only child, and my mom has two siblings. I’m also the eldest grandchild on her side.
            </p>
            <p>
              We come from a broken family — my parents are separated — but I still try to stay strong and positive. We have pets at home: a dog and a cat, who both bring me joy. I consider myself a simple kid. I’m usually quiet, though I can be noisy sometimes, especially when I’m with friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              My hobbies include playing basketball, online games, and cooking — something I really enjoy. I admit that I struggle in school; I’m a slow learner, and learning doesn’t come easy for me. I recently transferred to ICT because of some mistakes I made in my old school. Despite that, my experience in my new school has been very positive. It feels completely different from my old school — I’m happier now, and I’ve made new friends who are fun and supportive.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m now more determined to work hard in my studies so I can achieve my dreams and give back to my mother, who has sacrificed so much for me and my brother just to make sure we’re fed and taken care of.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used to be known as a "black child" — not just because of my skin color, but because of the wrong things I did when I was younger. I used to be dirty, disobedient, and careless. But as I’ve grown older, I’ve changed. I now carry myself better, look more mature, and try to act responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, I hope to be successful in life, to live peacefully with a happy family of my own, and to live free from problems. That’s my dream — and that’s all about me. Thank you for listening.
